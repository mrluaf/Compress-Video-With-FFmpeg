## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) must be installed on your system.

- The Video Processing Tool with FFmpeg requires Python 3.7.7 or later. Here's how you can check the Python version on your system:

  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

  Regarding the FFmpeg version, you've provided the information. Here's the excerpt from your message:

  ```
  ffmpeg version 4.2.3 Copyright (c) 2000-2020 the FFmpeg developers
  built with gcc 9.3.1 (GCC) 20200523
  ...
  ```

  So, you have FFmpeg version 4.2.3 installed on your system. If you encounter any issues related to Python or FFmpeg versions, you may need to update or install the required versions accordingly.

### Installation

#### Windows:

##### Method 1: Using the Command Line (Chocolatey):

1. Open a command prompt as an administrator. Right-click on the Start menu and select "Command Prompt (Admin)".

2. Install Chocolatey by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"

3. Install FFmpeg with Chocolatey:

   ```bash
   choco install ffmpeg
   ```

##### Method 2: Using the GUI (ChocolateyGUI):

1. Download and install ChocolateyGUI from the official website: [ChocolateyGUI](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ChocolateyGUI).

2. Open ChocolateyGUI, search for "ffmpeg," and click the "Install" button next to the FFmpeg package.

#### macOS:

##### Method 1: Using the Command Line (Homebrew):

1. Open Terminal. If you haven't installed Homebrew, install it by running:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Install FFmpeg with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```

##### Method 2: Using the GUI (Homebrew Bundle):

1. Download and install Homebrew Bundle from the official website: [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle).

2. Create a `Brewfile` containing the following line:

   ```bash
   tap "homebrew/bundle"
   brew "ffmpeg"
   ```

3. Run the following command in the directory containing the `Brewfile`:

   ```bash
   brew bundle
   ```

These methods should provide users, even those less familiar with the command line, with straightforward ways to install FFmpeg on both Windows and macOS. Users can choose the method that best fits their comfort level with the command line or graphical interfaces.
